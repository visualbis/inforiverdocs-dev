# Inline Charts

Inline charts are an interactive and dynamic way to present data in the form of a chart. This type of chart is very useful for presenting time series data, such as stock prices or sales figures. It is a type of chart that are used to visualize data in a linear format.

Inline charts are typically used to show the progress of data from one point to another. They are also used for comparing trends by showing how different variables change over time.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Only after selecting one column 3 types of Inline charts, Bar charts, Lollipop charts and Waterfall charts enable. other Inline charts option enables after selecting more than one column.

</aside>

The Charts section shows various types of charts 

1. **Bar Chart**: The bar chart shows the comparison of the values across categories
2. **Lollipop Chart**: Visualize a large number of categorical data using a pin or Lolipop charts
3. **Waterfall Chart**: Visualize the cumulative effect of a series of positive and negative values
4. **Stacked Chart**: Compare a primary measure to another measure using a bullet chart
5. **Line Linear Chart**: Visualize variation over time using line, area, column and win/loss sparkline
    1. **Sparkline Chart**: 
    2. **Dumbbell Plot Chart**:
6. **1.2**: Clicking on this button converts the column of the chart back to numeric values.

You can find customize tab that opens separately on the top for all the charts. You can click update the charts.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Bar charts, Lollipop and Waterfall charts cannot be applied to Grand total columns

### 1. Bar Charts

Vertical and horizontal rectangles are used to represent given data statistically. You can show the data in Bar charts when looking at a set of data and making comparisons between various categorical values. 

- Select the column and click on the Bar chart icon in Chart
- Select from the color option, Solid bar (IBCS format), Colored bars, Inverted color bars
- You can view the chart inside the column.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The customize tab will only appear after you select the column to customize

</aside>

**Customize**: You may customize your chart by choosing your own colours, axis, padding, and fill pattern. With this extension, you can create charts with a unique look

### 4. Stacked Charts

When used in dashboards visualizing KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), bullet charts excel at comparing actual results with forecasts. Bullet charts are inspired by regular bar graphs but provide additional context at the same time. In contrast to simple bar charts, stacked column charts include additional visual elements to provide users with additional context.

### 5. Sparkline Charts

A Sparkline is a small chart that displays data visually in a worksheet cell. You can use sparklines to demonstrate trends in a series of values, such as seasonal variations or economic cycles.

![Screenshot 2022-08-11 at 6.06.25 PM.png](/img/InlineCharts/Fig14.SparklineChartOption.png)

There are 3 types of Charts that we can show under Sparkline charts. This is a very useful charts to understand the trend.

1. Line Linear: In the above image you can see the first column shows line linear graph against trends. Trend data is also visible over the pattern.
2. Area Linear: in the above image, you can see the next column which shows the area linear chart where the trend value is shown along with the area covered during the transition.
3. Column representation: The visual representation of the trend can be effectively shown in sparkling column representation of the charts.
