# Export

In this document, let us get to know how the **Export** option works in Inforiver. Inforiver deals with two types of export: **Export to PDF** & **Export to Excel**. 

The export features generally focuses on exporting the desired visual as either PDF or Excel, downloading and saving it in the local system for future use. If required, you can view and edit the downloaded file and reuse the same file, thus reducing timeline.

 Let us see about the Export functionality and Page Settings in detail below. 

# Export to PDF

### Page Setup

This section includes the setting and format of the page to be exported based on your preferences. Click **Page Setup**, and a **Settings** window opens as shown.
